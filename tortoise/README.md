## DWI Acquisition, Processing, and Analysis
  This repository provides comprehensive information on the processing and analysis of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data. It includes detailed protocols for preprocessing, processing, and analyzing DWIs, along with the corresponding code and expected results. TORTOISEV4 (Tolerably Obsessive registration and Tensor Optimization Indolent Software Ensemble) was used extensively as the primary software for distortion correction and map generation. A thorough processing pipeline has been developed and documented in this repository, with additional details on each step provided within.

Note, there are bash scripts that aid in combining multiple steps in the TORTOISE and MRTRIX programs. This means that it is assumed you have these 2 programs pre-installed to use the supplemental bash scripts that we provide here.
